# Crop Data Analysis and Model Training

This project involves analyzing crop data and training machine learning models to predict certain outcomes. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses various Python libraries for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis and model training.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `saved_models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
- `README.md`: The file for description of the project.

## Requirements

I imported and installed necessary tools to efficiently work on this model.

- The codes are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and tensorflow/keras for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Analysis

The dataset is loaded from `data/cropdata.csv` and various preprocessing steps are performed, including filtering and scaling.

The steps involved in data analysis, model training, and assessment for crop data are demonstrated in this project. The results are presented for easier understanding, and the trained models are stored for further use.
